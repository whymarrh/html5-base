# HTML5 Base

In the same vein as the [HTML5 Boilerplate][1] and [Cinderblock][2], this is a starting point for future web projects. It's stripped to the bare essentials, allowing for a quick start and fleshing out as needed.

Note that `index.html` links to `*.min.*` files for both the JavaScript and the CSS. These files would be created from their respective `*.max.*` files using your favourite minifiers -- this stems from [an idea for max CSS files][3].
